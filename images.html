        <p>
            Over the last year, I have been getting very interested in fromsoftware's 
            library of games such as dark souls. But out of all of them Bloodborne is my
            favourite.

        <p>It received critical acclaim for its world design, lovecraftian themes and 
            fast paced gameplay. Unfortunately, it only released for the playstation 4
            which has greatly limited the amount of people who could play it.
