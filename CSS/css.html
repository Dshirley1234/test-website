        <h2>External CSS</h2>
        <p>This paragraph and header are designed with external css. External css uses an
            external file to store the css for the main code to call upon when its needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advantages of using external css is that the risk of errors is reduced. 
            The html is also made a bit tidier as the code for the style is stored in a different file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disadvantages of external CSS include slowing down a site's download time due to several 
            css files needing to be installed and pages unable to render due to external css files
            not being loaded.
